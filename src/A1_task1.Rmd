#For Task 1, use hierarchical clustering by complete linkage to create a dendrogram showing multivariate clustering for water chemistry by site, saved as lastname_firstname_a4_task1.html. 

#To perform hierarchical clustering by site, youâ€™ll want to make a data frame that has a single summary row per site (e.g. based on means from all observations at that site), then calculate the euclidean distance before performing complete linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering.

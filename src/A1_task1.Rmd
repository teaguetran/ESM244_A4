#For Task 1, use hierarchical clustering by complete linkage to create a dendrogram showing multivariate clustering for water chemistry by site, saved as lastname_firstname_a4_task1.html. 

#To perform hierarchical clustering by site, youâ€™ll want to make a data frame that has a single summary row per site (e.g. based on means from all observations at that site), then calculate the euclidean distance before performing complete linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering. 
#set up 
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

# Packages for cluster analysis:
library(NbClust)
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
library(dendextend)
library(ggdendro)

#read .csv in, clean names, change -999 to NA and drop NAs
stream_chem <- read.csv(here("data", "sbc_lter_registered_stream_chemistry.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() 


```

```{r, message= FALSE, warning = FALSE}

stream_chem <- stream_chem %>% 
  group_by(site_code) %>% 
  summarize(across(3:11, mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%

#scale the dataset

#set row name to site names
